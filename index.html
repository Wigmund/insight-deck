            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fire</strong><br>Fire represents action, initiative, creativity, and the drive to make things happen. It fuels momentum, inspires boldness, and sparks transformation across all aspects of growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Water</strong><br>Water embodies connection, emotional intelligence, and the power of relationships. It nurtures collaboration, empathy, and a harmonious environment for individuals and teams.</li>
                <li><strong>Air</strong><br>Air signifies clarity, strategy, and communication. It brings insight, critical thinking, and the ability to navigate challenges with thoughtful planning and perspective.</li>
                <li><strong>Earth</strong><br>Earth stands for execution, resources, and practical achievement. It grounds ideas in reality, supports skillful action, and ensures that intentions lead to tangible results.</li>
            </ul>
